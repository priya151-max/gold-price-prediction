# 📌 Overview

This project is a web-based **gold price prediction and analysis** system built using machine learning and front-end technologies. It uses historical gold price data from 2000 to 2025 and applies a Gradient Boosting Regressor for prediction along with anomaly detection to identify unusual price movements.

The application features a gold-themed, animated HTML interface that presents real-time insights in a clear and user-friendly manner.
